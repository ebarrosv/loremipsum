This repo has two main scripts: lipsum.sh, contar.sh, each one behaves in a different manner:

*lipsum.sh : First execute this to get random text from the site "lipsum.com" and puts the output to 5 files ending with *.txt
*contar.sh : When executed it reads the files generated previosuly and then it outputs the amount of lines in each file
